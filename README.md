TwitchPlaysProteus
==================

Twitch Plays Client Example - 

Proteus is a great game for the "Twitch Plays" paradigm. Even random input makes for a beautiul
and fulfilling experience. I'm using pircbot to listen to the twitch IRC server, and then parsing
the message log to get commands, which I'm passing to Proteus using the built in Robot Class.  I had
to change some of the settings in proteus to change the look functionality to work with jkli instead of
the mouse.

Updates to add: Custom IRC listener (for my own education). Better automation to idle the bot in a more
intuitive way. Automation to restart the game if nobody gives a command for a certain period of time (
the character will likely be somewhere lost at sea).

Let me know any suggestions: @steazgaming
